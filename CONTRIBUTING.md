# Contributing to bunkerweb-template-hub

Thanks for helping grow the BunkerWeb template ecosystem! This repository thrives when the community shares knowledge, fixes bugs, and keeps templates up to date for new scenarios. The information below covers the end-to-end process for contributing.

## Code of Conduct

We follow the tone and values of the BunkerWeb community: be respectful, be inclusive, and collaborate openly. Please review our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before participating. If you ever feel unsure, reach out before you submit and we will figure it out together.

## Contribution Workflow

1. **Fork** this repository and clone your fork locally.
2. **Create a branch** named after your change, e.g. `feature/wordpress-template`.
3. **Implement your update** (add a template, adjust docs, etc.) following the guidelines in this document and in [TEMPLATE_GUIDE.md](TEMPLATE_GUIDE.md).
4. **Test and lint** your contribution. For templates, validate configuration files where possible (e.g. `docker compose config`, `kubectl apply --server-dry-run`, schema validation).
5. **Commit** with clear messages that describe the change and reference any related issues.
6. **Open a Pull Request** against `main`:
   - Summarize the motivation and changes.
   - Highlight testing steps and expected outcomes.
   - Link issues or discussions that provide additional context.
7. **Participate in the review**. Address comments, push revisions, and keep the conversation open and collaborative.
8. Once approved, a maintainer will merge your PR.

## Template Submission Guidelines

To keep the hub tidy and easy to navigate, please align with these conventions:

- **Naming**: Use lowercase-kebab-case for directories (e.g. `wordpress`, `plex`, `nextcloud-hardening`). Prefer descriptive names that reflect the service or goal.
- **Folder structure**: Place template assets inside `templates/<template-name>/`. Avoid adding extra environment subdirectories; each template stands alone. At minimum, include a `template.json` that follows the BunkerWeb schema.
- **Template file**: `template.json` must define the template `name` and any `settings`, `configs`, or `steps` it relies on. Paths inside `configs` should resolve relative to the template directory.
- **Documentation**: Add a `README.md` or short `NOTES.md` when additional guidance helps users customize the template. Mention whether the template is meant for plugin distribution, UI upload, or both.
- **Examples**: When relevant, include sample configuration fragments under `configs/` and keep them referenced inside `template.json`.

Refer to [TEMPLATE_GUIDE.md](TEMPLATE_GUIDE.md) for detailed expectations and examples.

## Style & Quality Expectations

- **Consistency**: Follow the formatting rules in the template guide. Keep indentation, file naming, and JSON structure consistent.
- **Clarity**: Comment configuration blocks when the intent is not obvious. Avoid secrets or sensitive data.
- **Testing**: Share how you validated the template. Provide commands, logs, or screenshots if it helps reviewers.
- **Review readiness**: Ensure new templates are self-contained, with clear instructions and metadata, so reviewers can try them quickly.

## Pull Request Checklist
